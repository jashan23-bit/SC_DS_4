 TASK_4_COMPLETE___Traffic Accident Data Analysis &amp; Visualization ðŸš¦ðŸ“Š This project examines traffic accident patterns to uncover relationships between road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, it identifies accident hotspots and key contributing factors to improve road safety planning.



# Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization ðŸš¦ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors to support better urban planning and road safety measures.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed records of accidents, with information on location, timing, weather conditions, and severity.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends, correlations, and significant influencing factors.
- **Visualization**: Used heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots to illustrate accident hotspots and risk factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Explored machine learning techniques to assess accident risk.

## Results & Insights
- Accident frequency spikes during **rush hours** and **bad weather**.
- **Poor road conditions** significantly contribute to high-severity accidents.
- **Certain intersections** show repeated accidents, suggesting infrastructure improvements.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
